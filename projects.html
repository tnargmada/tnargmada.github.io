                Deeplocal is a creative technology firm based in Pittsburgh. They were hired to create an arcade machine for Google's popup Coding Carnival
                at the Iowa State Fair in August 2022. As an intern that summer, I wrote the software for the game running on the arcade machine, using P5JS
                and Electron. To play, kids inputted a sequence of directions for a tractor, and then ran that sequence to move the tractor and collect corn.

            <h3>Mobile App Concept<br>Computational Design, 2021</h3>
            <p class="middle">
                Scotty Reports is a reporting app concept for students at Carnegie Mellon University, created for a design course in a team of 4. We asked,
                how can we help CMU students feel more comfortable reporting incidents?

            <p>
                My primary role was developer, so I created the demo app to showcase the design, programming the voice interface and accomponying animations
                using P5JS.

            <p class="last">
                We found that many students are dissatisfied with how Carnegie Mellon responds to various incident reports, from academic issues to issues of
                harrassment or mental health risks, so we designed an app where students would be able to anonymously report, connect with other students
                reporting similar issues, and see concrete results from their reports.

                This project is a visualization of popular seasonal foods, created for a design course in a team of three. We focused on collecting reliable data

                My primary role was developer, and I was working on both the frontend and backend of the app. The frontend of the site is written with simple
                HTML/CSS/JS; the backend uses the NYT Cooking API to collect a list of recipes, and the Google Trends API to calculate their monthly popularity.

                Troutwood is a financial tech startup based in Pittsburgh. Their goal is to bring financial independence to more people by making investing more
                approachable. They created Finulator to bring financial education to young students, because there is a strong lack of such education in the
                schooling system.
