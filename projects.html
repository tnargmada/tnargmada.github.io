                Deeplocal is a creative technology firm based in Pittsburgh. They were hired to create an arcade machine for Google's popup Coding Carnival
                at the Iowa State Fair in August 2022. As an intern that summer, I wrote the software for the game running on the arcade machine, using P5JS
                and Electron. To play, kids inputted a sequence of directions for a tractor, and then ran that sequence to move the tractor and collect corn.
                The game helped kids learn the basics of sequencing as a coding concept in an engaging way. It was played over 9,000 times during the 11-day event.

                Scotty Reports is a voice-based reporting app concept for students at Carnegie Mellon University, created for a design course in a team of 4. We wanted
                to help students feel more comfortable reporting incidents on campus.

                My primary role was developer, so I created a demo to showcase the design, programming the voice interface and accompanying animations using P5JS.
                I also assisted with the design process, conducting research with current students, and creating a user flow for a voice-based interface.

            <p class="last">
                Finding that many students weren't satisfied with Carnegie Mellon's incident reporting systems, we designed an app where students would be able to
                more easily report academic or personal issues, and see concrete results from their reports. The visual identity of the app was based on Carnegie Mellon's
                "Tartan Wave," a motif used across university branding. We drew a parallel between the threads of the Tartan pattern and the threads of the user's
                conversation.

                HTML/CSS/JS; the backend uses the NYT Cooking API to collect a list of recipes, and the Google Trends API to calculate their monthly popularity.
                I was also involved in the UI design process, creating Figma prototypes and developing a clear presentation of the data.

                Blitz Services is an innovative startup in data automation. After working on custom automation solutions in the insurance industry, we identified an
                opportunity to leverage large language models to create a general data extraction solution, converting PDF forms into structured JSON or CSV files.

            <p class="last">
                I engineered the backend, hosting multiple virtual machines on Google Cloud to process PDF data for interpretation by our custom LLM. I also worked
                on the frontend, employing React and Bootstrap for a seamless user experience. The tool's successful integration into Blitz's data pipeline was a
                significant milestone, not just for our original client but also in attracting interest from major players in the insurance industry.
