                        Deeplocal is a creative technology firm based in Pittsburgh.
                        They were hired to create an arcade machine for Google's popup Coding Carnival at the
                        Iowa State Fair in August 2022. As an intern that summer, I wrote the
                        software for the game running on the arcade machine, using P5JS and Electron.
                        To play, kids inputted a sequence of directions for a tractor, and then ran that
                        sequence to move the tractor and collect corn.

                        Scotty Reports is a reporting app concept for students at Carnegie Mellon University.
                        It was created as part of the course Computational Design Thinking, in a team of four.
                        We found that many students are dissatisfied with how Carnegie Mellon responds to various
                        incident reports, from academic issues to issues of harrassment or mental health risks,
                        so we designed an app where students would be able to anonymously report, connect with
                        other students reporting similar issues, and see concrete results from their reports.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 40px">
                        To showcase the design, we created a voice user interface and accompanying animations,
                        using P5JS. I was the developer of the group, so I wrote the code for both the voice
                        recognition and the animations.

                        This project is a visualization of popular seasonal foods, created as part of the
                        course Computational Design Thinking, in a team of three. It displays foods that have
                        the largest spikes in popularity in a certain month. For example, eggnog is especially
                        popular in December. The frontend of the site is written with simple HTML/CSS/JS, and
                        the backend uses the NYT Cooking API to collect a list of recipes, and the Google Trends
                        API to calculate their monthly popularity.

                        Troutwood is a financial tech startup based in Pittsburgh.
                        Their goal is to bring financial independence to more people by making investing more
                        approachable. Following this goal, they created Finulator, a financial simulator game
                        for high school students. When I was an intern there, I designed the UI for the game,
                        and created around 200 asset images.
