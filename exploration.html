                Eel is a 3D version of the classic Snake game. I wrote it when I was learning object-oriented programming.
                I first wrote it in Java, using the Processing library, then rewrote it in P5JS for the web.

                This was a project to turn Google privacy settings into a puzzle game. It presents a list of steps to turn off
                Google's personal data collection, and rewards you for doing so. Since these settings are already made
                intentionally difficult to navigate, I decided they would make a good game if points were added. I wanted
                to draw some attention to these design patterns, and I also used the project to learn how to create a browser
                extension. This extension was written using plain HTML/CSS/JS (using <a href="https://www.kirilv.com/canvas-confetti/">this confetti library</a>).

                I made a clock that mapped hours, minutes, and seconds onto red, green, blue values to create a color. It also shows
                the month, day, and year by the number of grey rectangles in the background.

                I made this as an assignment in a class called Computation for Creative Practice, taught by Golan Levin. Above you
                can see the final design in real-time, and in 5x speed. You can also see a couple other iterations, and some of my
                inspiration (Bauhaus color studies). This design was created using P5JS.

                I wanted to explore tangible interfaces, and alternative ways of interacting with a computer. I went through a few
                iterations of the idea; at one point I wanted to have a remote arm-wrestle experience to settle internet arguments.
                In the end, it was simpler to make it a one-person experience, so I decided person versus computer was best. I used
                a force sensor and a strong motor to simulate the tug-of-war experience, and an Arduino to control the experience.
